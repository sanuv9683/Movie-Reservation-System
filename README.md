## Movie Reservation System (RMI)
As a client project I developed this project for controlling the realtime process of movie ticket reservation
and managing the client requests of booking tickets from the counters. from using this application
users can reserve their movies themself or from the help of the counters..by using this system users can also view
movie trailers.

## Motivation
*Letting customers to enjoy the user experiance through a system and reduse the busy environment around the counters
of the movie theater*.
